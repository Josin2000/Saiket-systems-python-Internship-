Once upon a time in a land far, far away, there lived a king who had three sons. The king was wise and just, and he ruled his kingdom with fairness and compassion.

The eldest son was brave and strong, the second son was clever and quick-witted, and the youngest son was kind and gentle. The king loved all his sons dearly and wanted to find suitable wives for them.

One day, the king called his sons to him and said, "My dear sons, it is time for you to find your brides. I will set a task for each of you. The one who completes his task most successfully will be given half of my kingdom as his reward."

The sons agreed, and the king gave each of them a different task. The eldest son was to bring back a magical sword from the dragon's lair, the second son was to find the golden apple from the enchanted forest, and the youngest son was to bring back a crystal flower from the mountain peak.

The sons set out on their quests, each determined to win his father's favor. The eldest son fought bravely and defeated the dragon, bringing back the magical sword. The second son outwitted the guardian of the enchanted forest and returned with the golden apple. The youngest son climbed the highest mountain and found the crystal flower, bringing it back to his father.

The king was pleased with all of his sons' efforts and rewarded them each with a part of his kingdom. The people of the land celebrated the bravery and wisdom of the king's sons, and they all lived happily ever after.
